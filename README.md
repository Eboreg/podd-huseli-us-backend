# podd-backend

This is simply my implementation of the backend part of my own podcast platform, [Spodcat](https://github.com/Eboreg/spodcat-backend). It's used [here](https://podd.huseli.us). If this repository is of any use to anyone else, it's probably as a working example, or perhaps my [code for fetching and importing HTTP request logs from Azure Files](src/podd_backend/azure.py) can be of interest?
